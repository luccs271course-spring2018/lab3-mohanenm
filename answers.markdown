Which of the two lists performs better as the size increases?
ArrayListAddRemove performs better at 10, as it had the lowest time (.049) seconds) than the other ones. Overall, Array list were vastly superior.

Also try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference?
list.remove(5) and list.remove(Integer.valueOf(5)) removes 5 from the list. The list would then be (4,3, 77, 4, 77, 77, 6).

What happens if you use list.remove(77)?
If you remove 77, all the 77s disappear. It just removes all of them since it is focused on 77.

list.remove(5);  what does this method do?
The .remove(5) will remove the element at index 5.

list.remove(Integer.valueOf(5)); what does this one do?
The list.remove(Integer.valueOf(5)) will remove the object with value of 5
